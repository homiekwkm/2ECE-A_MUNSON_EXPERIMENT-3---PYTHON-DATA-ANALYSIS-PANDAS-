# 2ECE-A_MUNSON_EXPERIMENT-3---PYTHON-DATA-ANALYSIS-PANDAS-

Experiment 3 requires us to make use of the Pandas library to make programs containing dataframes.

## Problem 1. 
Problem 1 requires us to first download a .csv file, cars.csv, to utilize in our dataframe. The data from this dataframe will then be displayed by the first five and the last five rows. The programs needs to be saved as a .py file, a file that is included in this repository along with the Jupyter notebook file.

## Problem 2. 
Problem 2 encompasses a more complex set of questions that need the employment of subsetting, sliciing, and indexing operations: 

\na. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.
\nb. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
\nc. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
\nd. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

The program needs to be saved as a .py file, a file that is included in this repository along with the Jupyter notebook file.
